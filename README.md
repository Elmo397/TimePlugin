### LocalTimePlugin
This is a plugin for Intellij IDEA that shows local time in StatusBar.    
By default, the plugin shows the day of the week, date and time:    
![default view](./DefaultView.png)    
But you can change the view by selecting it in popup menu:    
![view settings](./ViewSettings.png)
